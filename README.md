#### Rachel Fizel, Luis Gomez, Brandon Overlie, Stephanie Richards

This project examined the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on niceride rental and ridership patterns in 2020 as compared to previous years. We used data for the years 2015-2020 from niceride as the basis for our comparisons, and supplemented that data with information on Covid from the office of the Governor, weather data from NOAA, and Google Maps.
